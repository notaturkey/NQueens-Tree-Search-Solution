# Tree-Search-Solutions

This repository has a solution for the Klotski Board problem and the Nqueens problem using tree traversal. I made this in college so the implementations are a bit sloppy but the logic is still solid.
I Will be updating this repo soon to clean up the code and make some better design choices because they are obviously bad
